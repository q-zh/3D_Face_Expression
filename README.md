# 3D facial expression removal 

1. Please find our training model from: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1shatQaa-V0OX1cq7J_0G2Q  extract code: 9s7a

2. Please first compile omp and ksvd by running 'xxx/private/make.m' before running 'main_2d3d_exp_removal.m'.

3. 'abs' and 'ppm' files are from FRGC Ver2.0. Label of expression is acquired by method in https://pypi.org/project/fer/, while landmarks are obtained through method in https://github.com/1adrianb/2D-and-3D-face-alignment. 

4. We thank researchers kindly providing their codes of nricp, icp, omp, ksvd, mesh based warping face expression recognition,  landmarks detection, and etc.

5. If you find code is useful, please cite our paper (under review).
