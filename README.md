# 3D_Face_Expression

1. Please find our training model from: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1shatQaa-V0OX1cq7J_0G2Q  extract code: 9s7a

2. 'abs' and 'ppm' files are from FRGC Ver2.0. Label of expression is acquired by method in https://pypi.org/project/fer/, while landmarks are obtained through method in https://github.com/1adrianb/2D-and-3D-face-alignment. 

3. We thanks researchers providing their codes of nricp, icp, omp, ksvd, mesh based warping face expression recognition, and landmarks detection.

4. If you find code is useful, please cite our paper (to be published).
